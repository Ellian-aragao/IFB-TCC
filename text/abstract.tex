For the implementation of the proposed architecture, we developed a strategy to
automate \ac{cr} assignments which is based on two main components: a \acf{rbes}
and an \acf{ir} model. The strategy coordinately applies these two components in
different steps to find the potential developer to a \ac{cr}. The \ac{rbes}
takes care of the simple and complex rules necessary to consider contextual
information in the assignments, e.g., to prevent assigning a \ac{cr} to a busy
or unavailable developer. Since these rules vary from one organization/project
to another, the \ac{rbes} facilitates their modification for different contexts.
On the other hand, the \ac{ir} model is useful to make use of the historical
information of \ac{cr} assignments to match \acp{cr} and developers.
